# Express.js Route Parameter and Error Handling Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications related to improper handling of route parameters and database query failures. The `bug.js` file contains code with a potential error, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  The issue focuses on missing robust error handling when a user ID is not found. 

## Bug Description
The primary problem lies in the lack of comprehensive error handling within the `/users/:id` route.  If the database query fails to find a user with the specified ID, the application might crash or return an unhelpful error message to the client. This can lead to unexpected behavior and a poor user experience. 

## Solution
The corrected code in `bugSolution.js` addresses this by:
1. Explicitly checking if the `user` object is null or undefined after the database query.
2. Returning an appropriate HTTP status code (404 Not Found) with a descriptive message if the user is not found.
3. Adding more comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage database query failures or other potential exceptions.

## How to run the code:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install express` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Execute each file separately using Node.js: `node bug.js` and then `node bugSolution.js`.
